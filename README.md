# Tobias
Tobias (_Tests of bias_) is a suite of exploratory statistical tests for detecting subtle biases in clinical genomics resources. 

Our initial release (version 1) focuses on the marker of genetic ancestry. Through a variety of hypotheses and models, we ask whether this marker confounds the clinical interpretation of a genetic variant. These explorations are made possible by the public dissemination of data from two resources: ClinVar and EXaC. Most clinical laboratories and classification guidelines rely on these, to varying extents, in making their determination about the effect of a variant.

#### GUI:
Tobias comes accompanied by a web-based tooling to help clinicians and other non-technical researchers quickly visualize and explore a variety of hypotheses (under development).

#### Usage:
Describe code segments as well as use of packages here.
