# Tobias
Tobias (_Tests of bias_) is a suite of exploratory statistical tests for detecting and untangling the sources of bias that can affect genetic test results. 

Our initial release (version 1) focuses on the marker of genetic ancestry. Through a variety of hypotheses and models, we ask whether this marker - when ignored - confounds the clinical interpretation of a genetic variant. These explorations are made possible by data that is painstakingly aggregated and made available to the public by two resources: ClinVar and ExAC. 

ClinVar solicits, curates and disseminates the clinical interpretations assigned to variants by hundreds of clinical genetic test providers. ExAC collects, curates and disseminates petabytes of data from large population genomic sequencing projects, allowing us to precisely estimate the allele frequency of genetic lesions in different human populations. Most clinical laboratory processes as well as variant classification guidelines rely on these two resources (albeit to varying extents) in making their determination about the effect of a variant.

#### GUI:
Tobias comes with a web-based graphical user interface to help clinicians and other non-technical researchers quickly visualize and explore a variety of hypotheses (under development).
